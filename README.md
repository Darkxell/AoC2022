AoC 2022 answers, but it's actually good humanly readable java

Does not use external libs no one has ever heard about, and is easy to run on your own machine.

Using IDE:
1. In your IDE of choice (IntelliJ, eclipse...), open a maven project and selevt PoM.xml

Using CLI:
1. In the root folder of the repository, run ``mvn package``
2. Run it with java ``java -cp target/AoC2022-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar fr.darkxell.aoc2022.Main``
